# Student-loan-forgiveness
Last week I wrote a quick and simple program for my class that uses 2019 Survey of Consumer Finance data to examine student loan forgiveness of loans to respondents and to spouses of respondents that allows rough policy simulations of different forgiveness approaches. This program would need some QA before being directly used for policy--particularly given the exclusion of other household loans and some other issues around sample weights. The program also presumes that one downloads the data to a directory called SCF. 
Feel free to use this program or to modify it. Let me know if there are obvious avenues of improvement.
