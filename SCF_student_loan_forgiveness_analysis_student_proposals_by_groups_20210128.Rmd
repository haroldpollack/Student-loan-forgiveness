This markdown file analyzes student loan data 2019 Survey of Consumer Finance files.
In particular, it models proposals to "forgive" the first $K owed within defined populations, defined by an indicator dselect=1. A function does the rest of the work.
It provides the basis for some policies for student loan forgiveness.
We only examine the first six loans held by respondent or spouse.
We also follow Gale, Gelfond, Fitchtner, and Harris (2020) by multiplying SCFâ€™s survey weight x42001 by 0.2 to produce summary statistics.
https://protectborrowers.org/new-data-show-borrowers-of-color-and-low-income-borrowers-are-missing-out-on-key-protections-raising-significant-fair-lending-concerns/
We will restrict to loans owed by respondent or spouse, given data challenges to evaluating loans by other household members
